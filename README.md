### Background: 
<p align="justify">
Glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence is driven by profound metabolic adaptation; however, paired metabolomics studies that track metabolic evolution within the same patient are exceedingly limited. Plasma-based profiling provides a minimally invasive method to characterize systemic biochemical shifts associated with tumor progression and treatment pressure.
  
### Methods:
<p align="justify">
We conducted a proof-of-principle  study using both direct-infusion tandem mass spectrometry (DI-MS/MS) and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for untargeted plasma metabolomics in four patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-wildtype glioblastoma, using samples collected at primary diagnosis and at recurrence. .Data processing incorporated limit-of-detection (LOD) filtering, Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) curation, and paired Linear Models for Microarray Data (limma) modeling, followed by patient-specific fold-change analysis, metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA), maximum common substructure (MCS) interrogation, and joint metabolite–protein interaction (MPI) network integration

### Results: 
<p align="justify">
we found a consistent increase in arginine, asparagine, and threonine at recurrence, highlighting arginine biosynthesis and broader nitrogen-metabolic pathways as recurrent features across patients. However, we also found considerable heterogeneity involving mitochondrial dysfunction, one-carbon imbalance, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle remodeling, and amino acid and lipid catabolic shifts. Structural clustering demonstrated a clear separation between low-complexity polar metabolites and conserved lipid scaffolds, suggesting lipid remodeling during recurrence. Joint pathway analysis identified metabolic architectures involving amino acid, central carbon, and hypoxia-related pathways, with distinct overlays reflecting individualized metabolic vulnerabilities.

### Conclusions:
<p align="justify">
We found both shared and patient-specific metabolic architectures associated with GBM recurrence. The convergence on nitrogen handling, amino acid remodeling, and central carbon metabolism suggests conserved metabolic liabilities and putative drug-targetable pathways, whereas heterogeneity in lipid and mitochondrial pathways points to individualized metabolic strategies. These findings establish a framework for precision metabolic profiling and nominate metabolite-driven biomarkers and therapeutic targets for recurrent GBM.
